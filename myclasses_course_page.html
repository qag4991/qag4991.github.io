                <li class="content_li">The MyClasses home page is packed with information. Located on the left of the screen is the grades tab. This contains all of your current
                    and past grades. The classes are separated by semester and colored. If the color of the grade of a given class is green, that means you are passing that class, congratulations! If the color
                    is yellow; you are passing but close to the failing threshold. You may need to put in some more work. If the color is red, you are currently failing that class and should seek
                     help.<br><br>The middle of the home page houses the course shells. clicking on these will bring the student to the course content page for the specified class.<br>  <br>The right side of the home page is for a calander and to-do list. 
                     The calander autofills with teacher created assignments but can also be populated by the student. The same can be said about the to-do list. Assignments and tasks all have specified task values or importance ratings.<br>

                <p>For Instructors</p>
                <li class="content_li">Similarly to the student side of the website, the instructor side contains a lot of information. The instructor grade section is populated with current and past
                    classes, but the grades, unlike with the student section, are the grades of the students enrolled in that class. The color coding is the same as with the student page; green is passing, yellow
                    is barely passing, and red is failing. This is meant for instructors to be able to provide help to the students who are struggling.
                    help. <br><br>The middle of the home page houses the course shells. clicking on these will bring the instructor to the course editing page for the specified class where they will be able to

                    add new classes with the add classes button in the top right corner.<br>  <br>The right side of the home page is for a calander and to-do list. this works the same as the student calander.
